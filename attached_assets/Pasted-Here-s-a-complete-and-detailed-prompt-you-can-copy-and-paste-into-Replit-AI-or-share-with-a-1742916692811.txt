🟦 **Prompt for Replit AI to Build Moraqqat Website & App (Full Stack)**

> Build a modern, responsive, full-stack website and mobile app for a pet food subscription service called **Moraqqat**.

>
> ### 📱 Platform Overview:
> Moraqqat allows users to subscribe to monthly personalized pet food boxes. The user will first sign up, then create a profile for their pet (with details like name, breed, weight, age, dietary preferences, food type). Based on the answers, the system will recommend a subscription plan.
>
> ### 🧩 Key Features:
> #### Frontend (React / React Native):
> - Landing page with pricing tiers (Basic, Premium, VIP)
> - User registration/login page (JWT-authenticated)
> - Pet profile form (name, weight, age, dietary preferences)
> - Subscription selection with live pricing
> - User dashboard showing subscription status, deliveries, and profile updates
> - Add-on selector (litter, toys, treats)
> - WhatsApp support button
>
> #### Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB or Firebase):
> - Secure user registration and login (JWT)
> - Database for users, pets, subscriptions, orders
> - Logic to calculate package cost based on pet profile and selected add-ons

> - Pet birthday reminder and reward system
>
> #### APIs:
> - Payment gateway integration (Mada, Apple Pay, Stripe)
> - SMS/Email confirmation
> - WhatsApp Business API support (optional)
>
> ### 📦 Subscription Logic:
> - Tiers: Basic (210 SAR), Premium (280 SAR), VIP (350 SAR)
> - Add-ons: Litter, toys, treats (added cost, marked up 50-100%)
> - Discounts on 6-month and 12-month subscriptions (auto-applied)
> - System must calculate total price per user dynamically
>
> ### 🌍 Other Requirements:
> - Arabic/English language toggle (i18n support)
> - SEO-friendly for the web app
> - Responsive mobile-first design
> - Admin can edit prices and content via simple CMS panel
